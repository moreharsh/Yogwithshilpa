						I have been doing Yog with Shilpa for more than five years now. The classes
						are designed to include cardio,strength training stretching and breathing
						exercises. Certain vinyasa postures have improved my agility and posture.
						Shilpa is a dedicated teacher who is constantly upgrading her knowledge of
						yoga through learning and self practice. I highly recommend her class for
						both beginners and advanced learners.

						I have been learning yoga from Shilpa for the past 3 months. This is the first time I have
						tried yoga and I absolutely love it. Shilpa herself is full of energy and makes sure that
						every minute of this 1 hour is fully utilized. The way she plans the asanas and executes it
						with grace, it's just wonderful. <br>
						I, myself have seen good improvement in my stamina while running and a lot less soreness
						post run. I would recommend it to everyone. The best 60 minutes one can spend every morning.

						Choosing my first step towards weight loss at YogWithShilpa has proven to be a great decision.
						She always strives for perfection in postures and promotes us for the same by arranging weekend
						sessions; that eventually turn out to be weekend get-outs.I have felt that urge for a daily
						workout within three weeks of joining and started personally experiencing a beautiful change in
						me from the first week.

						Yoga class in the morning with Shilpa is like a fresh start with a positive

						Shilpa is very thorough with her approach and explanation of the ‘Asanas’;
						I love her way of conducting our virtual sessions. Shilpa’s yoga class is a fantastic experience
						in this new normal and allows us to develop physically and mentally. I feel fortunate to join

						I was looking for a good yoga teacher for the last few months and my search ended when I came
						across Shilpa. Shilpa is an excellent yoga teacher. She not only demonstrates each “ Asana “
						very thoroughly but also explains nicely the benefits of the Asanas to our mind and body. Her
						instructions are very clear which one can easily follow. It has been almost four months since I
						have started yoga with Shilpa but I see the tremendous positive impact on my energy level and
						freshness that I carry the entire day. In fact, I am recommending Shilpa’s yoga class to my
						friends and family members too.

						Me and my husband have been attending Shilpa’s Yoga classes for over 15months and I must tell
						you that it has been a great experience.
						Shilpa is a fabulous Yoga guru, there is never a dull moment in her class. She always makes sure
						that we all understand the Asanas and our postures are correct . Yoga is making us physically
						fit.
						In addition Yoga is also improving our concentration, calming our mind and bringing in physical
						flexibility. We look forward to continue the training with Shilpa

						The day I started Yoga with Shilpa, something really changed. It's not like I have never
						exercised before. I have been doing different activities to keep fit, and have been a very
						consistent exerciser for over 20 years. But recently, I was experiencing some aches and pains.I
						am happy to join a daily yoga-exercise class. Shilpa, our teacher is very precise with her
						instructions, explains the effects of the exercise as we are doing it, and at the end of it I
						feel energized and I am ready for the day.
						Thank you Shilpa.
